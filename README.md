A Hugo, TailwindCSS, and SanityCMS Starter Kit

---


## Overview
The "J" in JAMstack doesn't always have to represent JavaScript. Instead of a JavaScript framework, the robust Golang framework, Hugo, can also generate static sites.

This repository was born out of a need. I wanted to use Tailwind inside Hugo but I could not find anything that cleanly integrated the two. So, I decided to create a starter for those who are familiar with Tailwind but wanted to try out a working stack with HUGO and a headless CMS (SanityCMS).

### What's included?:

This pre-baked starter kit integrates:

**Hugo:** A high-performing Golang-powered static site generator.

**TailwindCSS:** The famous utility-first CSS framework.

**SanityCMS:** A fully customizable headless CMS, equipped with potent APIs for seamless content management and distribution.

#### Other features that are included:

- Node.js Scripts to pull data from a Sanity CMS
- Pretteier Support for Hugo
